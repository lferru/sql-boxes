# sql-touhou
An SQL demo

This is a script that interfaces with a simple SQLite database, touhou.db, which contains one table, CHARACTERS.
CHARACTERS has the columns name, hairColour, age, height, image, musicFile.
There are six operations: delete a single row, add a single row, display all rows, display an image, play a music file, and quit the script.

To run the script, enter the following in your shell:

python3 sql-touhou.py

The characters in this database are from the Touhou video game series.
